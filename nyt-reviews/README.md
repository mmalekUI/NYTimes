This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To fetch data from NYTAPI do following steps

Visit https://developer.nytimes.com/
● From the menu, select “Sign In” and then click on “Create an account”
● Fill the form and verify your email address
● Sign in using your login credentials
● Click on your email address in the top right corner and select “Apps” from the drop down
menu
● Press “+ NEW APP” button
● Name your app however you want
● From the APIs section, enable “Movie Reviews API”
● Hit “Save” to get your personal API key

Paste private api key to .env

To Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
